# Task: Developing a Financial Chatbot

## Objective
Develop a chatbot that responds to predefined queries about a company's financial performance, specifically focusing on net income and revenue growth.

## Steps

### 1. Rule-based Logic Implementation
Implement rule-based logic for the chatbot to handle queries. This involves creating a mapping of user queries to predefined responses. Ensure that the chatbot can handle errors by providing default responses when a query does not match any predefined responses.

### 2. Data Structuring and Retrieval
Structure the financial data in a CSV file named `financial_data.csv` which contains the company's financial information. While this example uses hardcoded responses, in a more advanced scenario, the chatbot should retrieve information from this structured data source. You can use a library like pandas to read the CSV and query the data.

### 3. Communicating Financial Insights
Design the chatbot's dialogue to be clear and informative. Summarize complex financial data into easy-to-understand insights. For a more interactive experience, expand the chatbot to suggest related queries or follow-up questions for more detail.

## Conclusion and Variation
This project demonstrates the core principles of developing a financial chatbot using rule-based logic. Depending on your technical skills, there are numerous ways to enhance and expand this prototype. Consider integrating more complex NLP features for natural language understanding, connecting to real-time financial databases for dynamic data retrieval, or implementing machine learning for more nuanced interaction and response generation.
